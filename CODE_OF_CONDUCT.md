## Introduction
The Zero To Mastery Community is dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free space and experience for all community participants, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, socioeconomic status, body size, ethnicity, nationality, level of experience, age, religion (or lack thereof), or other identity markers. Our Code of Conduct exists because of that dedication, and we do not tolerate harassment in any form. 

If you cannot be bothered to read this whole thing, here is a nice and short summary: **Be a good human, be nice, and help those that need help. This group is about learning and for improving our skills as a community in order to better ourselves. If that does not fit into what you want to talk about, there are better places on the internet for you to have those discussions.**

This Code of Conduct applies to __**EVERYONE**__ in **ALL** ZTM Community spaces, including:
 - ZTM Discord Server
 - ZTM open source repositories
 - ZTM Community events and meetups, online and offline
 - one-on-one communications pertaining to ZTM Community business. 
 
 Participants violating our Code of Conduct may be penalized or expelled at the discretion of community management.

Some ZTM Community spaces may have additional rules in place, which are posted publicly for participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules. We invite all those who participate in the ZTM Community to help us create safe and positive community experiences.

Consequences for noncompliance with the Code of Conduct may include a discussion with moderators, mediation with the participant you may have harassed, or as an absolute last resort, a ban from the community.
