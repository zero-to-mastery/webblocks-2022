> There is a big hype about front-end frameworks all over the place. But in this project we are going to build a showcase library of components using vanilla HTML, CSS and maybe some Javascript.

> Everyone is highly encouraged to partipate in this project regardless of your knowledge, after all practice makes us all better developers!

## ❇️ Getting Started with Hacktoberfest

Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source, organised by Digital Ocean. ([More details here](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Hacktoberfest-2022/blob/master/README.md#what-is-hacktoberfest))

If you've never made a pull request before, or participated in an open-source project, we recommend taking a look at:

- Our [Start Here Guidelines](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/start-here-guidelines)
- Our [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQLNFRviB6Q).

These two resources have everything you need to learn about open-source, with a step-by-step guide to making your very first PR. Once you've got your feet wet, you're ready to come back and dive into Hacktoberfest fun!

## ❇️ Rules

- Use only HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript
- Please make sure that the code is your own, and not copied from somewhere else
- That's it, have fun and make something unique and creative!

## ❇️ But what should I create?

> Well that is entirely upto you. Take a look at some of your favorite website and try to recreate one of their components but with your own spin. It could be anything ranging from a simple styled button or toggle switch to a complete contact form.

## ❇️ How to contribute

0. Start chatting with other ZTM students in the #hacktoberfest-2022 channel on our Discord to get help, work together, and share your contributions!

1. First up you need to fork (make a copy) of this repo to your Github account.

2. Clone (download) your fork to your computer

3. Set up your streams so you can sync your clone with the original repo (get the latest updates)

   - `git remote add upstream https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/webblocks-2022.git`
   - `git pull upstream master`
   - The above 2 commands will synchronize your forked version of the project with the actual repository.

4. Create a branch

5. In the blocks directory (folder), create a directory named after yourself.

6. Within this folder you just made, create three files, an HTML file, a CSS file, and a JS file.

7. Link your CSS and JS files to your HTML file.

8. Create a web component! It can be as simple or as complex as you like!

9. Grab a screenshot or gif of your final Web Block, ensuring that its nicely crop and preferably squared. Save this in your directory using `icon.png` as the name.
   _If you don't add a gif/screenshot, the website won't show your work in the thumbnail._

10. Next, create another file in your directory named `meta.json`, using the following template ensuring you replace the values for your own. This information will be used to automatically add your Web Block to the gallery **once** your PR is merged.

```json
{
  "block_name": "ZTM Button",
  "author_name": "Matt",
  "author_github_url": "https://github.com/MattCSmith/"
}
```

_Please keep `src/blocks.js` as it is._ If you follow step 10 above, a script will add your art automatically after your PR is merged.

11. Pull from the upstream again, like we did in step 3. This is to ensure we still have the latest code.

    - `git pull upstream master`

12. Commit and push the code to your fork

13. Create a pull request to have the changes merged from your fork into the origin

14. [Tweet about making your first Hacktoberfest pull request!](https://ctt.ac/3aU0d)
