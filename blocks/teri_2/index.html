                  Easy. We're bringing the convenience of room service to homes
                  across Africa – but starting with Lagos. Home tasks are
                  routine activities that should be outsourced, so you can focus
                  on the things with the most impact in your life. It could be
                  making time for work that matters, or for enjoyment. You
                  deserve to live well without the extra effort. Some people
                  call us the <span>Concierge of Comfort</span> – they're
                  correct.

                  We do all three. But you get to decide which works best for
                  you. If you need food, we'll get you delicious meals everyday,
                  once a week, or every two weeks. Dirty laundry? We'll pick
                  them up and bring back your clothes, freshly washed
                  folded/ironed. Does your home need cleaning? We'll get that
                  done efficiently as well. You can even subscribe for more than
                  one service, and we'll run it. Perfectly.

                  When you sign up on Eden, you can configure a plan that fits
                  your needs, then you get assigned a Gardener to help you
                  manage your home. The app takes your food, laundry, and home
                  cleaning needs and turns them into tasks that our Gardeners
                  attend to on schedule. The only finger you'll be lifting is
                  the one scrolling through the app, monitoring progress.

                  Your Home Managers. They’re the human side of Eden:
                  carefully-screened people (we run full background checks on
                  all Gardeners) who are trained to handle your home requests
                  with ease and enthusiasm. Our Gardeners fit a profile. They’re
                  detail-oriented, responsive, responsible and friendly. They
                  have one job, and that job is to understand what the perfect
                  home means for you specifically, then work every day to
                  provide you with exactly that. When you sign up on Eden, you
                  see a profile of your Gardener, and you can get an impression
                  of them before they start handling your chores.

                  A lot. Think of your Gardener as your link to an
                  ever-expanding world of Eden services you can take advantage
                  of. Your Gardener helps you access services like
                  <span>
                    meals, house cleaning (light and deep cleaning), and laundry
                    services.</span
                  >
                  And that's just the beginning. If there’s ever a service you
                  wish your Gardener provided (that they don’t, as yet), select
                  the ‘Feedback’ option on the Gardener profile, and we’ll get
                  the message!

                  Your Gardener’s schedule is designed to give the best
                  attention to your chores, which gives them (based on our very
                  trusty Eden math) enough time to attend to a few other
                  customers in the same area as you. This means that our
                  Gardeners attend to a handful of customers, but are never
                  swamped with requests.
