Angle of a Circle = 360°.
Therefore, each hand (Hour, Minute, Second) will rotote by 360°.
Hour hand will rotote 360° in 12 hours.
Minute hand will rotote 360° in 1 hour or 60 minutes.
Second hand will rotote 360° in 1 minute or 60 seconds.


But, each of the hands has some deviation with respect to each other in a particular time unit.
So, we have to calculate the deviation of the hands, for accurate & realistic output.

Deviation computation for:
1. Hour hand-
    12 hr -> 360°
    1 hr -> 30°
    or, 60 min -> 30°
    => 1 min -> (1/2)°

    So, angle deviation for hour hand = (30 * hr + (min / 2))

2. Minute hand-
    60 min -> 360°
    1 min -> 6°

    So, angle deviation for minute hand = (6 * min)

3. Second hand-
    60 sec -> 360°
    => 1 sec -> 6°

    So, angle deviation for second hand = (6 * sec)

Now, we are all done to move to coding part.
